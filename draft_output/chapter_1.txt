The training yard in Ebonreach City-State was paved with tightly packed grey stone, worn smooth and cool beneath bare feet by countless hours of practice. A faint scent of dust and sweat hung in the air, mingling with the sharper tang of oiled wood from the practice weapons. Here, beneath the watchful gaze of the city’s obsidian towers that clawed at the sky like jagged teeth, Alara moved like a whirlwind. The polished stone reflected the harsh midday sun, creating blinding flashes with each swift movement. Her form was precise, each strike and parry echoing with controlled power – a sharp *thwack* followed by a resonating *hum* as she sparred with Master Theron. He was a mountain of a man, his face etched with years of discipline, the deep lines around his eyes crinkling slightly as he observed her; yet she met his strength blow for blow. A rapid sequence of jabs targeted pressure points, followed by a fluid sweep of her leg aimed to unbalance him; he countered with a block and a forceful shove that sent her spinning, the wind whistling past her ears. She recovered instantly, landing lightly on the balls of her feet, the stone firm against her soles, already circling for another attack.

“Again,” Master Theron rumbled, his voice low and steady, vibrating in the air like distant thunder. “Focus your chi, Alara. You’re relying too much on brute strength.” The words tasted dry and familiar in the yard's atmosphere.

She nodded, frustration tightening her jaw, feeling the pulse throb in her temples. The power was there; she could feel it simmering beneath her skin like a caged beast – a tingling warmth that threatened to erupt. But channeling it… that remained the challenge. Her father had possessed an effortless grace, a connection to his ki that seemed almost innate. She hadn't inherited that gift. 

“I am,” Alara acknowledged, re-engaging with renewed focus. The clash of their wooden practice weapons filled the yard once more – a rhythmic *crack* and *thud* against the backdrop of the city’s hum. “It’s just… difficult.” The wood felt rough against her palms, slick with sweat.

Theron grunted, deflecting her attack, the sound like the groan of ancient timber. "Difficulty breeds strength, child. Your father would want you to persevere." His words were a carefully veiled acknowledgement of the shadow that always seemed to hang over Alara—the absence of her father, Kaelen, a renowned explorer who vanished five years ago on an expedition into the Whispering Wastes.

The mention of his name brought a familiar ache to her chest, a dull pressure behind her ribs. “I know,” she said softly, momentarily losing her rhythm. “I will.” The memory of him felt like a phantom limb—present yet unreachable. 

Aunt Lyra emerged from the training yard’s small pavilion, the heavy silk of her robes rustling against the stone – a quiet counterpoint to the sparring sounds. Her face was unreadable as always, sculpted into an expression of stoic calm. She was a woman sculpted from granite—strong, silent, and fiercely protective of Alara. "Theron," she greeted, her voice coolly polite, each syllable precise and measured. "Alara, you've sparred long enough. It's time for your medicinal bath.” The air around her seemed to carry the faintest scent of sandalwood and something sharper, almost metallic.

Alara bristled slightly at the interruption. “I wasn’t finished.” A frustrated sigh escaped her lips.

Lyra’s gaze was unwavering, like chips of ice. “Your body needs tending. Dwelling on what cannot be changed will not bring him back.” The words were gentle, but carried a weight of unspoken discouragement that settled heavy in Alara's stomach. She knew her aunt feared she would throw herself into the same reckless pursuit that had claimed her father. 

She bit back a sharp retort, tasting the bitterness on her tongue, and nodded curtly. As she moved to follow Lyra towards the bathing chambers, the flagstone cool against her bare feet, an image flashed in her mind: a younger Alara, no older than six, perched on her father’s broad shoulders as he pointed out constellations in the night sky, his laughter warm and genuine – a sound that echoed now only in memory. “The stars hold many secrets, little one,” she could almost hear him say, his voice raspy with affection. “Never stop searching for them.” 

The memory was bittersweet, a painful reminder of what she had lost. She glanced back at Master Theron, who offered a small, knowing nod—a silent understanding passing between them. Lyra led her away, the rustling of her robes fading into the yard’s background noise, but Alara's mind lingered on the Whispering Wastes and the secrets they held—secrets that might finally reveal what happened to her father. A sealed scroll, delivered this morning by a weary merchant from the borderlands, his face etched with worry lines, spoke of strange occurrences within the Wastes - disturbances in the earth that shook the ground, unusual animal behavior leaving unsettling tracks in the dust…and a symbol etched into the rocks, one she recognized from her father's journals—a spiraling glyph that sent a shiver down her spine.
