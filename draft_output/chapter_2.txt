Alara was meticulously cataloging newly acquired flora specimens when the messenger arrived. He stood in her doorway, a silent silhouette against the afternoon sun, its warmth radiating through the open archway and dusting him with golden light. His clothes were travel-worn—the leather of his tunic cracked and softened, the hem of his trousers dusted with ochre earth—and practical, offering no clue to his origin. He held out a single scroll sealed with crimson wax, the scent of beeswax and dried herbs clinging faintly to it, bearing an unfamiliar sigil that seemed to pulse with a subtle inner darkness.

“For Alara,” he stated, his voice low and flat, like stones shifting on a distant mountainside. Then, as quickly as he’d appeared, he turned and disappeared down the winding stone staircase, the echo of his footsteps fading into the cool, subterranean air.

Curiosity overriding protocol, Alara broke the seal immediately. The scroll unfurled with a brittle rustle, like autumn leaves skittering across cobblestones, revealing not a letter but a fragmented map rendered in faded ink on aged parchment that felt rough and dry beneath her fingertips. It depicted a mountain range she vaguely recognized near the Whisperwind Peaks, the peaks themselves jagged teeth against a pale sky in the artist’s rendering, though sections were torn, leaving raw edges along the paper, and others obscured by time's relentless dampness. Beneath the map, scrawled in an archaic dialect, was a single phrase: *“Ubi Sol Lapide Portam.”*

Alara frowned, her fingers tracing the strange script, feeling the raised texture of the ink against her skin. “An old Western tongue,” she murmured to herself, recognizing it as a form rarely used now except by scholars and relic hunters. "Where the Sunstone Gate..." The name resonated within her, stirring a forgotten echo in the depths of her memory—a fleeting image of sun-warmed stone and swirling golden light. The Sunstone Gate was legend—a mythical passage supposedly leading to a place of immense power, lost centuries ago during the Sundering. 

“The Sunstone Gate,” she repeated, with more conviction this time. It was mentioned only in fragmented historical texts and whispered folklore – dismissed by most as fanciful tales. Yet, here it was, referenced in what seemed to be an authentic document. But why send it to *her*? What did they want her to do? A shiver traced its way down her spine, the coolness prickling against her skin, a mixture of excitement and apprehension tightening her chest. Someone knew she would recognize the significance of the phrase; someone had deliberately sought her out. 

A sudden knock on the door startled her. It was Master Bram, his face etched with unusual urgency, lines deepening around his eyes like cracks in ancient pottery. “Alara,” he began, his voice hushed, tasting of concern and something she couldn't quite place, "a rider has just arrived from the King’s Citadel.”
