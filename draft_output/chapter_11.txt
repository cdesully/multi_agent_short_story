The rain lashed against the windows of Jarik’s study, a frantic drumming like desperate fingers seeking entry, mirroring the tempest brewing within Alara. The scent of aged parchment and dried herbs hung heavy in the air, layered over the faint metallic tang of alchemical compounds. Books lined the walls, their leather spines cracked and worn, hinting at a wealth of knowledge—the gold-leaf titles glinted faintly in the dim light—knowledge she suspected Jarik was carefully guarding. He hadn't met her gaze when she entered, busying himself with rearranging vials on a cluttered table, the glass clinking softly against each other, but she knew he felt her scrutiny. The air crackled with unspoken accusations and veiled threats; a palpable tension that pressed against her skin like a physical weight.

“You were in the service of Lord Kaelen,” Alara began, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands—a subtle vibration she could feel as much as hear. She watched him closely, searching for any tell—a flicker of discomfort behind his shadowed eyes, a hesitation in his breath—that would betray his secrets.

Jarik continued to fiddle with the vials, pausing before answering, the cool glass smooth beneath his fingertips. "My services are often required by many," he said, his tone carefully neutral and evasive, each word precise and measured. 

Alara’s breath hitched. It was a deflection, but she pressed on, abandoning any pretense of casualness. “He died ten years ago. You must have known something about him.” The raw edge in her voice surprised even her, tasting bitter on her tongue.

Jarik paused, the clinking of glass ceasing abruptly as if silenced by an invisible hand. He slowly turned to face her, his expression unreadable in the dim light cast by a single oil lamp that sputtered and hissed nearby. "My father taught me early on that knowledge is power," he said, his voice low and measured, resonating slightly in the confined space. “Information…is currency.” A muscle ticked in his jaw, visible even in the shadows, as if the words were difficult to admit, a subtle tension radiating outwards.

“You knew my father,” Alara stated, the accusation hanging heavy in the air—a suffocating presence she could almost touch. The years of suppressed grief and anger threatened to spill over, tightening her throat until it burned with unshed tears. 

Jarik’s lips curved into a fleeting, almost imperceptible flicker of amusement before he masked it with practiced ease, the movement so swift as to be missed. “Lord Kaelen was…a notable figure,” he offered vaguely. "There were many who knew him." The words felt like sand slipping through her fingers.

“Don’t patronize me,” Alara snapped, her voice cracking slightly from the strain, a raw vulnerability exposed despite her efforts to conceal it. She took a step closer, forcing herself to meet his gaze—his eyes dark pools reflecting the flickering lamplight. “I deserve more than platitudes and evasions. Tell me what you know about my father's death.” 

Jarik leaned back in his chair, the worn leather creaking beneath his weight, a sound that amplified the silence between them. He seemed almost amused by her intensity, a subtle curl playing at the corner of his lips. "My knowledge is not freely given," he said softly, his voice a silken thread designed to ensnare. "Information of that nature…it requires further compensation."
